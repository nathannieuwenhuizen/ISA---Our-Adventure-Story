		<h2>About</h2>
			<p> Hello readers, this is an experiment I want to conduct with you guys.</p>
			<p>This choose your own adventure story will be written by you guys! I don't know if this story will be super huge or just one part only written by me.</p>
			<p>Also I want to see what crazy stuff you guys will come up with the parts you will write.</p>
			<br>
			<p> If you want to give me some feedback, you can try to read a story and write some create parts you can come up with. Also you can help me out by filling up the google form down below! </p>
			<p> I hope you enjoy this project I have so far, and maybe it will become bigger!</p>
