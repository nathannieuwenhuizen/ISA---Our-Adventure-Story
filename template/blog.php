        <h3> Second itteration | 7-6-2019</h3>
        <p>
        The website has been updated. It is therfore the end of my induvidual study for tihs project. I'll probably work on it later in July when I have summer vacation. <br>
The most important features are as follows:<br>
1. You can edit a story that you have just written if images do not work or if there are grammatical errors.
Removal of a part is not possible to prevent trolls.<br>
2. You can see the information about the statistics of the story per story, you can also see if recent pieces have been written.<br>
3. There is an additional story beginning where you can write too!<br><br>
Enjoy!
